            <p>Welcome to Playsculpt! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Playsculpt website, games, and any other services we provide (collectively, the "Service"). By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

            <font size="3"><b>1. Your Account</b></font>
            <p>You are responsible for everything that happens through your account. Do not share your password with anyone. You must be at least 13 years old to create an account on Playsculpt. If you are under 18, you must have permission from a parent or legal guardian.</p>

            <font size="3"><b>2. User Conduct</b></font>
            <p>Playsculpt is a creative community. We expect all users to be respectful. You agree not to do any of the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Harass, bully, or threaten other users.</li>
              <li>Post any content that is inappropriate, defamatory, or hateful.</li>
              <li>Use cheats, exploits, or bots to gain an unfair advantage in games.</li>
              <li>Attempt to scam other users out of their virtual items or accounts.</li>
              <li>Impersonate a Playsculpt staff member or another user.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Violation of these rules may result in a temporary or permanent ban from the Service.</p>

            <font size="3"><b>3. User-Generated Content</b></font>
            <p>Anything you build, script, or create on Playsculpt ("User-Generated Content" or "UGC") is yours. However, by creating UGC on our platform, you grant Playsculpt a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, and display your UGC in connection with the Service. This allows us to, for example, show your creations to other players on the Games page.</p>
            <p>You are responsible for the content you create. Do not upload or build anything that infringes on someone else's copyright or trademark.</p>

            <font size="3"><b>4. Virtual Currency and Items</b></font>
            <p>The Service may include virtual currency ("SculptBux") or virtual items that can be purchased with real money. These virtual goods are licenses, not property, and have no "real world" monetary value. All sales are final, and we do not offer refunds. We may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate virtual items at any time.</p>

            <font size="3"><b>5. Termination</b></font>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your account at any time, without notice, for any reason, including for a breach of these Terms. If your account is terminated, you will not have access to your account, including any virtual items or currency you have acquired.</p>

            <font size="3"><b>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</b></font>
            <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICE WILL ALWAYS BE SAFE, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT IT WILL FUNCTION WITHOUT DISRUPTIONS, DELAYS, OR IMPERFECTIONS.</p>

            <font size="3"><b>7. Changes to the Terms</b></font>
            <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. We will do our best to notify you of any significant changes. Your continued use of the Service after the changes become effective means you agree to the new Terms.</p>

            <p>Thank you for being a part of the Playsculpt community!</p>
